  <notes-entry|articles-wishes.tm|A wishlist for <TeXmacs> articles|It would
  be useful to have some short articles or tutorials covering the topics
  listed here below. This article collects them in the hope that someone will
  contribute them to the blog. They can also be considered interesting
  exercises to improve one own <TeXmacs> knowledge: learning by teaching. In
  case you manage to cover, even partially, one of the topic, please add a
  remark here to point to relevant material. If the topic is covered, move it
  to the \PAlready covered\Q section.|Sat Dec \ 5 23:35:37 2020 UTC>

  <notes-entry|wishlist.tm|Wishlist|This wishlist collects suggestions for

  should be clear that the functionality is not already provided in some
  form. This wishlist must not be used for very broad and vague requests
  (e.g. ``make the program more versatile and powerful").|Sat Dec \ 5
