    <p>
      We need syntax highlighting computations when rendering verbatim code
      snippets and also when exporting to HTML, for example. Currently there
      is some parsing library written in C++ inside TeXmacs (see the
      <tt>src/System/Language</tt> directory), but this does not cover HTML
      output and it is quite rudimentary. In this blog for example we achieve
      syntax-highlighting for HTML via an external JavaScript library. It
      would be useful just to output the appropriate elaborated text (together
      with a plain-text version for copy/paste). In general it could be maybe
      interesting to evaluate the use of external libraries for syntax
      analysis of programming languages.

          Tree-sitter is a recent interesting library for computing
          incrementally an AST for a piece of text, including error recovery.
          It is written in C/C++ with no external dependencies (as it is
          claimed) which make relatively easy an inclusion in TeXmacs. The
          github <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">link</a>, and a presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To">talk</a> on

    <h2 id="auto-4">3.<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Parsing Markdown and other languages<span
    style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      It could be useful for us to be able to parse the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</a>
      format. There are various available parsers which could be integrated as
      plugins in the codebase, for example <a href="https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown">PEG-markdown</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vmg/sundown">sundown</a>,
      <a href="https://fossil.instinctive.eu/libsoldout/index">libsoldout</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mity/md4c">md4c</a> and also some native scheme
      implementations like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/DerGuteMoritz/lowdown/src/master/">lowdown</a> for Chicken Scheme. Currently
      in TeXmacs we do not have a generic way to parse external languages: for
      example internally the parsing of HTML or TeX is done via C++ code
      without any common parsing substrate (as far as I can see). There is
      some support for packrat parsing but it is used only in the semantic
      checking of math formulas and it seems that the packrat parser is not
      capable of semantic actions, i.e. can only report if a string (or tree?)
      belongs to some language or not. Tree-sitter could also be an option as
      generic parsing mechanism. It could be useful to think how to factor and
      restructure the parsing mechanisms in TeXmacs to avoid duplicating
      code/efforts/know-how.

      This could be an area where we can improve substantially over
      LaTeX-based workflows, probably. We need to check what is done in other
      text-processing software. Some interesting resources

          offer the possibility to use it as an external service (on the web

          <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> is a protocol to interface clients to

          already have a very primitive plugin here <a href="https://github.com/mgubi/tm_jupyter">tm_jupyter</a>
          (written in Python). It could potentially replace many of our
          various plugins and allow easier maintenance. Moreover it could
          allow TeXmacs to be an alternative to Jupyter notebooks or <a href="https://github.com/mgubi/tm_jupyter">
          Jupyter Qt Console</a>. One can look to these projects to understand
          which features have to be supported. Jeroen has improved the

    <h2 id="auto-7">6.<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>General attachments to documents and to PDF
    files<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      In some circumstances it is useful to transmit both a PDF version of a
      document and the associated TeXmacs file (eventually with all the needed
      support files like custom styles and images). This allow usual PDF
      viewers to open the file and at the same time allows users of TeXmacs to
      be able to retrieve an editable version of the document for
      modification. It is useful to augment PDF with additional information to
      improve the user experience on a variety of platforms which do not allow
      to access the original TeXmacs documents. The PDF format gives the
      possibility to embed arbitrary content within the document as
      &ldquo;Embedded file&rdquo; streams. This possibility is exploited by
      the LaTeX package <a href="https://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/attachfile/attachfile.pdf">attachfile</a> which allows to associate to
      typesetted parts of the document arbitrary attachments with the
      possibility to recover it. We could introduce a similar features in
      TeXmacs. Various possible directions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          first include external content in a TeXmacs document, as already
          happens with images, but in a way that each document has its own
          filesystem which can be manipulated.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          include a TeXmacs document within a generated PDF file in such a way
          that it is possible to open the PDF from TeXmacs and edit its source
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          develop optional augmentation of the generated PDF by adding popups
          for link previews, and possibly create style files for generating
          more interactive PDF (e.g. show answers to questions, popups with
          arbitrary information, &hellip;) See this tutorial to see how this
          might be implemented in the PDF format (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGTbcqUMJcI">youtube</a>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          write code which insert in the PDF interactive features like popups
          (for preview or for additional content), better tables of content,
          etc&hellip;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          add some more meta informations to the PDF file, like an interface
          (a PDF form) to record metadata explicitly and maybe a modification
          log, some more informations about the bibliography, preview links
          (like in the UI), and LaTeX translations of the formulas to allow
          correct copy/paste in the PDF.

    <p>
      Modifications to the documents are incremental, so one would like to
      take this into account when recomputing both the typesetting and the
      rendering onscreen. This problem is also relevant when syncronizing
      live-editing document across a network connection. Some infrastructure
      is already present in TeXmacs (details?). Here are gathered some
      approaches to incremental computations in a general context.

    <p>
      <b>What:</b> Help improve the collaborative features of TeXmacs, in
      particular add user cursors to the live documents and improve
      performance or add peer-to-peer infrastructure to the live document
      handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why:</b>  TeXmacs has already collaborative capabilities. See e.g.
      the support in <code>$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/server</code> and
      <code>$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/client</code>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      We support live documents, chat rooms and shared file server. However
      these features are still experimental and need testing, some more
      security handling (authentication, etc&hellip;), etc&hellip; and they
      depends on a central server (another TeXmacs instance) which should be
      publicly visible on the Internet (i.e. have its own IP address).

    <p>
      <b>How:</b> Various directions are possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Better UI: the current UI does not give much feedback to the user,
          especially wrt. problems in the connection to the server, successful
          connection, liveliness of the server, etc&hellip;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Implement user cursors in live documents : a users should be able to
          see where other users are actively working.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Investigate performance issue in the current implementation and
          improve on them. Also investigate other possible mechanism of
          synchronisation, e.g. the one used in <code>Typst</code> or other
          collaborative solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Develop some server-side architecture and relative monitoring to run
          the Mogan server in a cloud solution like Amazon AWS or similar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Alternatively (and much better than the central server solution),
          investigate the possibility to create a peer-to-peer network using
          modern internet technologies where clients can connect together and
          sync their content without the presence of a centralised authority.

          NAT hole punching like these require the use of an intermediate

          or use DHTs like the p2p-socket solution with uses <a href="http://holepunch.io/">holepunch.io</a>

          the GNU project has its own p2p communication platform called <a
          href="https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux">JAMI 1</a>. Docs are here: <a href="https://docs.jami.net/">https://docs.jami.net</a>
          they have all the APIs and infrastructure which allow to connect two
          clients to exchange info, we could leverage that for TeXmacs, and
          maybe also write a TeXmacs plugin for JAMI so that one can
          collaborate via teleconferencing and work on the same document (to
          be seen, I've not yet looked in detail in their plugin system).

      <b>What:</b> Add support for OpenType MATH table &amp; related font

      investigate the possibility to remove the old TeX fonts and only use
      modern OpenType font containers (at least for the default fonts).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why:</b> At the moment TeXmacs is able to use only very few math
      fonts (like Stix, TeX Gyre) and this support is hardwired in the C++
      files and does not take into account all the informations available in
      the font files.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fonts file contain the position in the font of extensible brackets
      or extensible glyphs like arrows, square roots, etc&hellip;, and the
      metrics to correctly position index and subscripts.

      Some time ago mgubi started to implement some OpenType font support for
      TeXmacs, here: <a href="https://github.com/mgubi/texmacs/tree/wip-unicode-math">https://github.com/mgubi/texmacs/tree/wip-unicode-math
      2</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      TeXmacs still depends very much on old font formats while there are now
      available many free fonts in OpenType format which make it easier to
      support professional math typesetting. In particular there are Latin
      Modern fonts which can replace our old TeX fonts, and possibly improve
      speed since there will be less font searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      One side goal could be to get rid of all TeX fonts and distribute only
      the OpenType variants. This is for example what ConTeXt does.:

    <p>
      <b>How:</b> Study and document the font selection mechanism in TeXmacs,
      in particular how math glyphs are selected from the various fonts.
      Possibly write some debugging tools which allow developers to check the
      workings of which glyphs are selected, which metrics used, etc&hellip;
